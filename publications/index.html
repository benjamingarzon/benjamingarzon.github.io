Evidence on subjectively experienced short-term effects in multiple exposures to UHF MR is scarce. The purpose of this study is to investigated experience of short-term effects, and occurrence of motion in healthy subjects exposed to seven weekly 7 T MR examinations. Methods  A questionnaire on short-term effects was completed by participants in an fMRI motor skill study. Seven UHF MR examinations were conducted over 7 weeks (exposure number: 1 to 7). Changes of experienced short-term effects were analyzed. Motion in fMRI images was quantified. Results  The questionnaire was completed 360 times by 67 participants after one to seven 7T MR examinations. Logistic mixed model analysis showed a significant association between dizziness, inconsistent movement, nausea, and headache and the examination numbers (p\textless0.03). Exposure to repeated examinations had no significant effect on peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) or motion of the subjects. The overall experience of a 7T examination improved significantly (p\textless0.001) with increasing examination numbers. Conclusion  During multiple 7T examinations, subjects adapt to the strong static field. The short-term effects dizziness, inconsistent movement, nausea, and headache decrease over time as the MR sessions continue and experienced comfort increases. There was no significant difference in motion during the multiple fMRI examinations.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2023</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="garzon_investigating_2023" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Investigating associations of delay discounting with brain structure, working memory, and episodic memory</div> <div class="author"> <em>Benjamín Garzón</em>, Zeb Kurth-Nelson , Lars Bäckman , and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 2 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '2 more authors' ?

The neurobiological mechanisms behind DD are not well understood and the literature on structural correlates of DD shows inconsistencies. Methods: Here we leveraged a large openly available dataset (n = 1196) to investigate associations with memory performance and gray and white matter correlates of DD using linked independent component analysis. Results: Greater DD was related to smaller anterior temporal gray matter volume. Associations of DD with total cortical volume, subcortical volumes, markers of white matter microscopic organization, working memory, and episodic memory scores were not significant after controlling for education and income. Conclusion: Effects of size comparable to the one we identified would be unlikely to be replicated with sample sizes common in many previous studies in this domain, which may explain the incongruities in the literature. The paucity and small size of the effects detected in our data underscore the importance of using large samples together with methods that accommodate their statistical structure and appropriate control for confounders, as well as the need to devise paradigms with improved task parameter reliability in studies relating brain structure and cognitive abilities with DD.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="garzon_cortical_2023" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Cortical changes during the learning of sequences of simultaneous finger presses</div> <div class="author"> <em>Benjamín Garzón</em>, Gunther Helms , Hampus Olsson , and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 4 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '4 more authors' ?

In this longitudinal study in younger adults, we acquired performance and neuroimaging (7 T MRI) measures weekly over the course of 6 weeks to investigate neural changes associated with learning sequences of simultaneous finger presses executed with the non-­dominant hand. Both the intervention group (n = 33), which practiced the finger sequences at home, and the control group (n = 30, no home practice) showed general performance improvements, but performance improved more and became more consistent for sequences that were intensively trained by the intervention group, relative to those that were not. Brain activity for trained sequences decreased compared with untrained sequences in the bilateral parietal and premotor cortices. No training-r­elated changes in the primary sensorimotor areas were detected. The similarity of activation patterns between trained and untrained sequences decreased in secondary, but not primary, sensorimotor areas, while the similarity of the activation patterns between different trained sequences did not show reliable changes. Neither the variability of activation patterns across trials, nor the estimates of brain structure displayed practice-­related changes that reached statistical significance. Overall, the main correlate of learning configural sequences was a reduction in brain activity in secondary motor areas.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2021</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="lebedev_psychedelic_2021" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Psychedelic drug use and schizotypy in young adults</div> <div class="author"> Alexander V.

In particular, the link between psychedelic use and psychotic symptoms has been debated while no conclusive evidence has been presented. Here, we studied an adult population (n = 1032) with a special focus on young (18–35 years) and healthy individuals (n = 701) to evaluate the association of psychedelic drug use with schizotypy and evidence integration impairment typically observed in psychosis-spectrum disorders. Experimental behavioural testing was performed in a subsample of the subjects (n = 39). We observed higher schizotypy scores in psychedelic users in the total sample. However, the effect size was notably small and only marginally significant when considering young and healthy subjects (Cohen’s d = 0.13). Controlling for concomitant drug use, none of our analyses found significant associations between psychedelic use and schizotypal traits. Results from experimental testing showed that total exposure to psychedelics (frequency and temporal proximity of use) was associated with better evidence integration (Cohen’s d = 0.13) and a higher sensitivity of fear responses (Cohen’s d = 1.05) to the effects instructed knowledge in a reversal aversive learning task modelled computationally with skin conductance response and pupillometry. This effect was present even when controlling for demographics and concomitant drug use. On a group level, however, only difference in sensitivity of fear responses to instructed knowledge reached statistical significance. Taken together, our findings suggest that psychedelic drug use is only weakly associated with psychosis-like symptoms, which, in turn, is to a large extent explained by psychiatric comorbidities and use of other psychoactive substances. Our results also suggest that psychedelics may have an effect on flexibility of evidence integration and aversive learning processes, that may be linked to recently suggested therapeutic effects of psychedelic drugs in non-psychotic psychiatric populations.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="moutoussis_decision-making_2021" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Decision-making ability, psychopathology, and brain connectivity</div> <div class="author"> Michael Moutoussis , <em>Benjamín Garzón</em>, Sharon Neufeld , and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 44 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '44 more authors' ?

Here, we ask whether a common factor underpins our diverse decision-making abilities. We obtained 32 decision-making measures from 830 young people and identiﬁed a common factor that we call ‘‘decision acuity,’’ which was distinct from IQ and reﬂected a generic decision-making ability. Decision acuity was decreased in those with aberrant thinking and low general social functioning. Crucially, decision acuity and IQ had dissociable brain signatures, in terms of their associated neural networks of resting-state functional connectivity. Decision acuity was reliably measured, and its relationship with functional connectivity was also stable when measured in the same individuals 18 months later. Thus, our behavioral and brain data identify a new cognitive construct that underpins decision-making ability across multiple domains. This construct may be important for understanding mental health, particularly regarding poor social function and aberrant thought patterns.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="garzon_role_2021" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Role of dopamine and gray matter density in aging effects and individual differences of functional connectomes</div> <div class="author"> <em>Benjamín Garzón</em>, Martin Lövdén , Lieke Boer , and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 5 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '5 more authors' ?

We investigated the distribution of these effects across the connectome and their relationship with age-related differences in dopamine (DA) D1 receptor availability and gray matter density (GMD). With this aim, we determined aging effects on mean and interindividual variance of FC using fMRI in 30 younger and 30 older healthy subjects and mapped the contribution of each connection to the patterns of age-related similarity loss. Aging effects on mean FC accounted mainly for the dissimilarity between connectomes of younger and older adults, and were related, across brain regions, to aging effects on DA D1 receptor availability. Aging effects on the variance of FC indicated a global increase in variance with advancing age, explained connectome dissimilarity among older subjects and were related to aging effects on variance of GMD. The relationship between aging and the similarity of connectomes can thus be partly explained by age differences in DA modulation and gray matter structure.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2020</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="lovden_human_2020" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Human skill learning: expansion, exploration, selection, and refinement</div> <div class="author"> Martin Lövdén , <em>Benjamín Garzón</em>, and Ulman Lindenberger </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Current Opinion in Behavioral Sciences</em>, Dec 2020 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="persson_positive_2020" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">A positive influence of basal ganglia iron concentration on implicit sequence learning</div> <div class="author"> Jonas Persson , <em>Benjamín Garzón</em>, Rouslan Sitnikov , and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 2 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '2 more authors' ?

In two independent samples, we investigate the link between iron concentration in the basal ganglia (BG) and implicit sequence learning (ISL). In Study 1, we used quantitative susceptibility mapping and task-related fMRI to examine associations among regional iron concentration measurements, brain activation, and ISL in younger and older adults. In Study 2, we examined the link between brain iron and ISL using a metric derived from fMRI in an age-homogenous sample of older adults. Three main findings were obtained. First, BG iron concentration was positively related to ISL in both studies. Second, ISL was robust for both younger and older adults, and performance-related activation was found in fronto-striatal regions across both age groups. Third, BG iron was positively linked to task-related BOLD signal in fronto-striatal regions. This is the first study investigating the relationship among brain iron accumulation, functional brain activation, and ISL, and the results suggest that higher brain iron concentration may be linked to better neurocognitive functioning in this particular task.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="de_boer_corticostriatal_2020" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Corticostriatal White Matter Integrity and Dopamine D1 Receptor Availability Predict Age Differences in Prefrontal Value Signaling during Reward Learning</div> <div class="author"> Lieke Boer , <em>Benjamín Garzón</em>, Jan Axelsson , and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 4 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '4 more authors' ?

The dopaminergically innervated corticostriatal circuit in the brain plays an important role in supporting successful probabilistic reward learning. Several components of the corticostriatal circuit deteriorate with age, as it does probabilistic reward learning. We showed previously that D1 receptor availability in NAcc predicts the strength of anticipatory value signaling in vmPFC, a neural correlate of probabilistic learning that is attenuated in older participants and predicts probabilistic reward learning performance. We investigated how white matter integrity in the pathway between nucleus accumbens (NAcc) and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) relates to the strength of anticipatory value signaling in vmPFC in younger and older participants. We found that in a sample of 22 old and 23 young participants, fractional anisotropy in the pathway between NAcc and vmPFC predicted the strength of value signaling in vmPFC independently from D1 receptor availability in NAcc. These findings provide tentative evidence that integrity in the dopaminergic and white matter pathways of corticostriatal circuitry supports the expression of value signaling in vmPFC which supports reward learning, however, the limited sample size calls for independent replication. These and future findings could add to the improved understanding of how corticostriatal integrity contributes to reward learning ability.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2018</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="garzon_automated_2018" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Automated segmentation of midbrain structures with high iron content</div> <div class="author"> <em>Benjamín Garzón</em>, Rouslan Sitnikov , Lars Bäckman , and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 1 more author" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '1 more author' ?

Average Dice scores were 0.81 (0.05) for the SN, 0.66 (0.14) for the STN and 0.88 (0.04) for the RN in the left hemisphere, and similar values were obtained for the right hemisphere. In all structures, volumes of manual and automatically obtained segmentations were signiﬁcantly correlated. The algorithm showed lower accuracy on R2* and T2-weighted Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) images, which are also sensitive to iron content. To illustrate an application of the method, we show that the automated segmentations were comparable to the manual ones regarding detection of age-related diﬀerences to putative iron content.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2017</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="kalpouzos_higher_2017" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Higher Striatal Iron Concentration is Linked to Frontostriatal Underactivation and Poorer Memory in Normal Aging</div> <div class="author"> Grégoria Kalpouzos , <em>Benjamín Garzón</em>, Rouslan Sitnikov , and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 4 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '4 more authors' ?

However, an overload of free iron is toxic, inducing oxidative stress and cell death. Although an increase of striatal iron has been related to atrophy and impaired cognitive performance, the link between elevated iron and altered brain activity in aging remains unexplored. In a sample of 37 younger and older adults, we examined whether higher striatal iron concentration could underlie age-related differences in frontostriatal activity induced by mental imagery of motor and non-motor scenes, and poorer recall of the scenes. Higher striatal iron concentration was linked to underrecruitment of frontostriatal regions regardless of age and striatal volume, the iron-activity association in right putamen being primarily driven by the older adults. In older age, higher striatal iron was related to poorer memory. Altered astrocytic functions could account for the link between brain iron and brain activity, as astrocytes are involved in iron buffering, neurovascular coupling, and synaptic activity. Our preliminary ﬁndings, which need to be replicated in a larger sample, suggest a potential frontostriatal target for intervention to counteract negative effects of iron accumulation on brain function and cognition.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="garzon_can_2017" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Can transverse relaxation rates in deep gray matter be approximated from functional and T2-weighted FLAIR scans for relative brain iron quantification?</div> <div class="author"> <em>Benjamín Garzón</em>, Rouslan Sitnikov , Lars Bäckman , and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 1 more author" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '1 more author' ?

In vivo measurements of R2∗ transverse relaxation rates and quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) have been shown to be strongly correlated with iron concentration in tissue, but their calculation requires the acquisition of a multi-echo gradient recalled echo sequence (MGRE). In the current study, we examined the feasibility of approximating R2∗ rates using metrics derived from fMRI-EPI and T2-weighted FLAIR images, which are widely available. In a sample of 40 healthy subjects, we obtained these metrics (vEPI and vFLAIR), as well as R2∗ rates and QSM estimates, and found signiﬁcant correlations between vEPI and vFLAIR and R2∗ rates in several subcortical gray matter regions known to accumulate iron, but not in a control corticospinal white matter region. These relationships were preserved after referencing vEPI and vFLAIR with respect to the values in the control region. Effect sizes (above 0.5 for some of the regions, particularly the largest ones) were calculated and put in relation to those of the correlation between QSM and R2∗ rates. We propose that the metrics described here may be applied, possibly in a retrospective fashion, to analyze datasets with available EPI or T2-weighted FLAIR scans (and lacking a MGRE sequence), to devise new hypotheses regarding links between iron concentration in brain tissue and other variables of interest.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2013</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="olsen_functional_2013" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">The Functional Topography and Temporal Dynamics of Overlapping and Distinct Brain Activations for Adaptive Task Control and Stable Task-set Maintenance during Performance of an fMRI-adapted Clinical Continuous Performance Test</div> <div class="author"> Alexander Olsen , Jan Ferenc Brunner , Kari Anne Indredavik Evensen , and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 3 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '3 more authors' ?

Dorsal medial PFC and anterior insula may form a “core network” for attention control, which is believed to operate on both temporal scales. However, both the existence of such a network as well as the unique functional topography for adaptive and stable attention processes is still highly debated. In this study, 87 healthy participants performed a clinical not-X continuous performance test optimized for use in a mixed block and event-related fMRI design. We observed overlapping activations related to stable and adaptive attention processes in dorsal medial PFC and anterior insula/adjacent cortex as well as in the right inferior parietal lobe and middle temporal gyrus. We also identified areas of activations uniquely related to stable and adaptive attention processes in widespread cortical, cerebellar, and subcortical areas. Interestingly, the functional topography within the PFC indicated a rostro-caudal distribution of adaptive, relative to stable, attention processes. There was also evidence for a time-on-task effect for activations related to stable, but not adaptive, attention processes. Our results provide further evidence for a “core network” for attention control that is accompanied by unique areas of activation involved in domain-specific processes operating on different temporal scales. In addition, our results give new insights into the functional topography of stable and adaptive attention processes and their temporal dynamics in the context of an extensively used clinical attention test.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2011</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="jensen_diffusionweighted_2011" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Diffusion‐weighted and dynamic contrast‐enhanced MRI in evaluation of early treatment effects during neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer patients</div> <div class="author"> Line R.

Materials and Methods: DW- and DCE-MRI acquisitions of 15 breast cancer patients were performed before and after one cycle of NAC. MRI tumor diameter and volume, apparent diffusion coefﬁcient (ADC) and kinetic parameters (Ktrans, ve) were derived. The reliability of ADC before NAC was assessed. Changes in MRI parameters after NAC were analyzed, and logistic regression analysis was used to ﬁnd the best predictors for pathologic response. Results: The reliability for ADC values was high, with intraclass correlation coefﬁcient of 0.84 (P ¼ 0.001). After one cycle of NAC, MRI tumor diameter (8%, P ¼ 0.005) and tumor volume (30%, P ¼ 0.008) was reduced for all patients, while ADC mean values increased (0.12 mm2/s, P ¼ 0.008). The best predictor for treatment response was a change in MRI tumor diameter with mean error rate of 0.167 (13% for responders, 5% for nonresponders, P ¼ 0.291). Conclusion: Changes in MRI derived tumor diameter and ADC after only one cycle of NAC could provide a valuable tool for early evaluation of treatment effects in breast cancer patients.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="garzon_multiparametric_2011" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Multiparametric analysis of magnetic resonance images for glioma grading and patient survival time prediction</div> <div class="author"> <em>Benjamín Garzón</em>, Kyrre E Emblem , Kim Mouridsen , and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 7 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '7 more authors' ?

Purpose: To investigate multiple MR-derived image features with respect to diagnostic accuracy in tumor grading and survival prediction in glioma patients. Material and Methods: T1 pre- and post-contrast, T2 and dynamic susceptibility contrast scans of 74 glioma patients with histologically conﬁrmed grade were acquired. For each patient, a set of statistical features was obtained from the parametric maps derived from the original images, in a region-of-interest encompassing the tumor volume. A forward stepwise selection procedure was used to ﬁnd the best combinations of features for grade prediction with a cross-validated logistic model and survival time prediction with a cox proportional-hazards regression. Results: Presence/absence of enhancement paired with kurtosis of the FM (ﬁrst moment of the ﬁrst-pass curve) was the feature combination that best predicted tumor grade (grade II vs. grade III–IV; median AUC ¼ 0.96), with the main contribution being due to the ﬁrst of the features. A lower predictive value (median AUC ¼ 0.82) was obtained when grade IV tumors were excluded. Presence/absence of enhancement alone was the best predictor for survival time, and the regression was signiﬁcant (P , 0.0001). Conclusion: Presence/absence of enhancement, reﬂecting transendothelial leakage, was the feature with highest predictive value for grade and survival time in glioma patients.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> </div> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2024 Benjamín Garzón.
